# CS303A3
## Queue Implementation and Sorting
Dylan Sullins

## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of a templated Queue. There are two versions of insertion sort, one algorithm rewritten for the user-defined Queue using a user-defined peek_and_pop() function, the other copied from lecture 10 for sorting a vector. In the second sort implementation, the Queue is copied into a vector, and the vector is sorted then copied in order back into the queue.
